# HueBoard

HueBoard is a browser based control panel for the Philips Hue system in your home. Turning on the lights is just a click away (more features soon).

This website uses the [Hue API](https://developers.meethue.com/develop/hue-api/) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/blargoner/jshue) to talk to the bridges in your home. As a result, no login required (except pressing the button on your local bridge), all the data of your home, lights, groups etc. stays on your device.

But why having a website, that is essentially the same as the app? Good question. It came from a personal preference. When I'm sitting at the computer in my home office, it's easier for me to pull up a website than looking for my phone, unlock it, opening up the app, opening the room and turning on a light. You could also use this website in fullscreen mode on a wall mounted tablet etc.

## Features
To get a feel of all the features, you can check out the [demo page](https://hueboard.com/demo.html). But here's a broad overview of all features:

* Overview of rooms and zones
* Control individual light's on/off state for each room/zone
